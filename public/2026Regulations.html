        The new and improved car regulation for the 2026 season onwards includes a lot of changes for the cars to become more eco-friendly, faster, safer, and more importantly, better racing. The weight of the cars will be lessened by 30 kg, a power unit which will be more eco-friendly as it will use sustainable gasses without changing the performance of the car, active aero will make its return to the sport as X mode(Faster) and Z mode(Normal). Manual Override Mode(MOM) will be a replacement for the Overtake Battery as drivers can activate it at anytime they want to gain on their opponents and overtake them, and more importantly, the safety of the cars will be better as the safety equipment will be tested with harder and harder tests to determine if they are race safe.

        The Regulations, one of the main staples of F1 to change the design and how the car is built, these include how the aero of the car is supposed to be made, how the Power Unit will be upgraded, how other upgrades will replace the use of DRS and ERS Overtake button, and others. These changes are made to potentially enhance the F1 races.

The 2026 Formula Regulations changed a lot from the 2022 Regulations, for one, the weight of the car in around 30 kg lighter in most situations, this weight is because of the removal of the MGU-K aspect of the power unit, as well as shortening the length and width of the car. The Power Unit will receive an upgrade as it will be made 50/50 split on a Gas powered unit and an Electric engine, not only that, but the engine will completely run of 100% sustainable and recyclable fuel. The biggest change in the sport is active aero coming back after being banned in 2021,  it will replace DRS with two modes, Z-mode being the aero we see normally used when taking corners, and X-mode, being the drag reduced version of the Z-mode, for use on the straights and corners which used to take DRS. Finally, the MOM AKA the Manual Override Mode is a driver mode replacing the ERS/Overtake. It can be activated by drivers anytime they want to have a gain on their opponents to hopefully overtake or defend against them, the mode gives the engine a massive boost of power so that the car becomes faster and has quicker acceleration.  Finally, one massive change most wanted, was the rigorous testing done on the F1 Safety Equipment the is going to be used in race weekends, like the Halo, HANS device, Survival pod, Break away wings, and others, to keep the sport much safer to ensure that no more deaths happen.
