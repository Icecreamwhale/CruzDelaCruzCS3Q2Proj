    <h1>Practice(1, 2, and 3)</h1>
     <div>
    <p class = 'parts'> In F1, before any Qualifying or Race, there are always Practice Sessions. These Sessions are mostly used for a team to figure out their strategies on Race Days, including when to pit, or the setup of their car. Practice 1 is usually for Drivers to practice the track and to record data for their teams, this also lets the team know which setups are best used for that said track, Practice 2 is usually for tyre data gathering, so that teams know what to do to keep their tyres longer lasting in the race, and for drivers to practice for longer stints on track, finally, Practice 3 is for teams to make last minute changes to their setups so that they know if their car is actually ready for the race.</p>

  <p class = 'parts'>In Qualifying, Teams will use the fastest setup of their car to hopefully sit on the front row of the grid and have a big chance of winning the Grand Prix, this will determine at which positions will each driver start at. Qualifying 1 is where most drivers are safe with the top 15 advancing, while the rest is locked in from P16-P20, same goes for Qualifying 2, the top 10 cars advance to Qualifying 3, while the P11 to P15 is locked in. In Qualifying 3, the drivrs who made it into the top fight for positions on the grid slot for the race tomorrow, whoever got P1 gets 1 additional point, but the system was tarnished before the 2025 Season.</p>

    <h1>Grand Prix</h1>
     <div>
    <p class = 'parts'>In the Grand Prix, drivers will race each other for a chance to get in the top 10 and get points for themselves in the Driver's Championship, and their team for the Constructor's Championship, the points system goes like this, P1=25, P2=18, P3=15, P4=12, P5=10, P6=8, P7=6, P8=4, P9=2, P10=1. The Drivers and teams who are capable of winning the Championship usually go for the top 3, whilst midfield drivers/teams usually go for top 6 so that they can help solidify themselves as good drivers so that they can retain their seat in the sport, and for that team to signal to the other drivers who are looking for teams that they are the best option, specially if the driver is still developing.</p>
